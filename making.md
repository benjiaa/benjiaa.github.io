# 3D Scanned Hands: Making and Collaboration

![hands!](../assets/hands.png)

During my time at Colby, I’ve had the opportunity to work in the Muleworks Innovation lab. Muleworks is a makerspace where students, faculty/staff, and members of the local community can come to make stuff for class, research, and (most importantly) for fun! I’ve picked up so many new skills and worked with so many creative and passionate people there, and this particular project demonstrates the collaborative environment of the space so well.


One afternoon in the winter of 2019, my coworkers and I decided to make a concerted effort at finally using the lab’s 3D scanner. Due to dodgily made software and poor documentation, this tool had been laying on a shelf unused for a couple of years because nobody had been able to make it work. After dusting off the scanner, installing new drivers on a nearby desktop computer with a hefty enough GPU, and sinking a couple of hours into learning the quirks of the scanning process, we had finally gotten some decent scans. 


To highlight the machine’s strengths, I thought it would be pretty cool to get lifelike 1:1 scale models of some of our hands. Each of us wore a homemade paper bracelet with reflective markers attached to it and patiently posed while someone else walked in a circle around their hand. After scanning and saving the models as STL files and touching them up in blender to make them print-ready, we used the lab’s fleet of Ultimaker 3’s to create a little forest of scale models hands. These little sculptures still live in Muleworks to this day, and they’re one of the first things I show visitors who are curious about 3D printing and its capabilities.


Special thanks to Nicole Petherbridge and Sabina Garibovic for their patience in 3D hand modelling, as well as Jon Curtis for his blender prowess.
